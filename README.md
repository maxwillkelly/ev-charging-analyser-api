# EV Charging Analyser Back-end API
## What is EV Charging Analyser?
EV Charging Analyser is a manufacturer agnostic companion app for electric vehicles (EVs). EV Charging Analyser uses [Smartcar Connect](https://smartcar.com/product/connect/) which allows drivers to connect their EVs with ease using the login to their manufacturer's account. From there, users can perform basic tasks with their EV such as to lock or unlock the doors or see its location on their phone. We use this application to collect navigation and charging data for academic research. 

EV Charging Analyser is divided into two projects: the front-end mobile application [ev-charging-analyser](https://github.com/maxwillkelly/ev-charging-analyser) which uses React Native to compile binaries for iOS and Android (Android was the main development platform) and the back-end API [ev-charging-analyser-api](https://github.com/maxwillkelly/ev-charging-analyser-api) which uses NestJS. Each project has their own Github repository, deployment mechanisms, CI/CD tools and documentation. 

Regardless, both the front-end and the back-end projects use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as their programming language. TypeScript is a compiler that adds additional features most notably static typing to regular JavaScript.

## This repository
In this repository, we focus on the back-end API. The documentation for the front-end mobile application can be found here: [Front-end Mobile App Docs](https://github.com/maxwillkelly/ev-charging-analyser/wiki).

## Quickstart
To run the API, I recommend looking at the [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/maxwillkelly/ev-charging-analyser-api/wiki/Quickstart).

## Developing
